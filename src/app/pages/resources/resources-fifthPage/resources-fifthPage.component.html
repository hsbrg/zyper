      Why Setting the Right Conversion Events is Critical for Google Ads
    </h1>
    <h6>
      Setting up accurate conversion events in Google Ads is one of the most
      critical steps to measure success and optimize ad performance. Without
      proper conversion tracking, you won’t have a clear understanding of what
      actions users take on your site after clicking your ads. This means you
      could be wasting ad budget on non-converting traffic or missing out on key
      opportunities to improve your campaigns.
    </h6>
    <h6>Key reasons for setting the right conversion events:</h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Maximize Return on Ad Spend (RoAS): You’ll understand which ads,
        keywords, and campaigns are driving valuable actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optimize for Business Goals: Setting conversion events aligned with your
        business objectives ensures your campaigns are optimized for the right
        actions, whether it’s purchases, lead forms, or app downloads.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve Bidding Efficiency: Conversion events enable automated bidding
        strategies (like Target CPA or Target ROAS) to work more efficiently,
        allowing AI algorithms to maximize conversions.

    <h1 class="common-section-title">
      What Conversion Events Need Google Tag Manager (GTM) & Which Don’t
    </h1>
    <h6>
      Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a powerful tool that helps deploy marketing
      and analytics tags without modifying your site’s code. However, not every
      conversion event requires GTM.
    </h6>
    <h6>Conversion Events Requiring GTM:</h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Complex user actions such as scroll depth, page engagement, or form
        submissions (GTM can fire tags upon completion of these events).
      </li>
      <li>
        Custom events not natively trackable in Google Ads (e.g., AJAX-based
        form submissions).
      </li>
      <li>
        Events requiring additional data (like custom event parameters) beyond
        the basic pageview.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Conversion Events That Don’t Require GTM:</h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Basic conversion actions like purchases, calls from ads, or app installs
        that can be tracked directly through Google Ads or Google Analytics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Ads account-level conversions such as goal completions from
        Analytics.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Understanding Attribution Tracking in Conversion Events -->
  <div class="common-section-structure">
    <h1 class="common-section-title">
      Understanding Attribution Tracking in Conversion Events
    </h1>
    <h6>
      Attribution tracking is crucial to understanding how each marketing
      touchpoint contributes to conversions. By default, Google Ads uses a
      ‘last-click’ attribution model, but you can adjust this to better reflect
      user behavior across multiple touchpoints.
    </h6>
    <h6>Types of Attribution Models Available :</h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Last Click: Credit goes to the last interaction before the conversion. .
      </li>
      <li>First Click: Credit goes to the first interaction. .</li>
      <li>Linear: Equal credit to all touchpoints.</li>
      <li>
        Time Decay: More credit to interactions closer to the time of
        conversion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Position-Based: 40% credit to the first and last interactions, 20% to
        the ones in between.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data-Driven: Uses machine learning to determine which touchpoints are
        most impactful.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>How Attribution Models Affect Campaign Optimization:</h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Different models provide insights into how early-stage actions, like
        video views or blog visits, contribute to conversions. This helps you
        adjust bids or budgets to emphasize the most effective touchpoints.

    <h1 class="common-section-title">
      Common Challenges When Setting Up Google Ads Conversion Events
    </h1>
    <h6>
      While setting up conversion events is essential, it’s not always
      straightforward. Here are some common challenges businesses face:
    </h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Tracking Gaps: Missing out on key conversion points because they aren’t
        tagged properly (e.g., misconfigured forms or missing thank you pages).
      </li>
      <li>
        Double Counting Conversions: Conversion events firing multiple times due
        to improper trigger settings, leading to inaccurate reporting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cross-Device Attribution: Difficulty tracking users across devices or
        platforms, which can skew results if not properly addressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        GTM Setup Errors: Incorrect tag or trigger setup in Google Tag Manager
        leading to missed conversion events.
      </li>
      <li>
        Event Duplication in Analytics: Google Ads conversions may overlap with
        Google Analytics goals if they’re not de-duplicated, inflating your
        numbers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="common-section-structure">
    <h1 class="common-section-title">
      Passing Parameter Values with Conversion Events for Better Insights
    </h1>
    <h6>
      Passing dynamic values with your conversion events can help you track more
      granular data and improve optimization efforts. For example, you can pass
      values like order amounts, product types, or user IDs along with your
      conversion event.
    </h6>
    <h6>Steps to Pass Parameter Values:</h6>
    <ul class="common-section-required-steps">
      <li>
        Use Google Tag Manager: Set up custom event tracking using GTM where you
        can define variables such as transaction value or product category.
      </li>
      <li>
        URL Parameters in Campaigns: Ensure campaign URLs include UTM parameters
        that can be captured in your Google Analytics or Ads account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Link Google Analytics to Google Ads: This enables the passing of key
        values like revenue, transaction IDs, and product information, allowing
        for better reporting and bid optimization.
