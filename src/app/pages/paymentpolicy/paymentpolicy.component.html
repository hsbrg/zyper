      <h4>Payment Terms</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          Subscription fees are due in advance and must be paid on the
          subscription start date. This includes monthly, quarterly, or annual
          payments as per the chosen subscription plan.
        </span>

        <br />

        <span>
          We Zyper.ai accept payments through Stripe and Razorpay gateways including
          through credit card, debit card, direct transfer and UPI. Please note
          subscription fees shall be charged annually or monthly depending on
          package chosen, and performance marketing fee shall be charged on a
          weekly basis, as per percentage of ad spend managed in the chosen
          contract. Taxes and other regulatory payments are extra.

      <h4>Price Changes</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          We reserve the right to modify the subscription prices. Any price
          changes will be announced at least 30 days before they take effect.
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          Continued use of the service after the price change comes into effect
          constitutes your agreement to pay the modified amount.

      <h4>Billing Information</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          You are responsible for providing current, complete, and accurate
          billing and contact information. You must promptly update all
          information to keep your billing account current, complete, and
          accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or
          credit card expiration date).

      <h4>Subscription Cancellation by User</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          You may cancel your subscription at any time. Your cancellation will
          take effect at the end of the current paid term.
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will become

          receive a refund for any remaining period of your subscription.

    <div class="legal">
      <h4>Termination by Company</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your subscription and/or
          access to our services if you fail to comply with our terms and
          policies or if payments are not made on time.
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          A pro-rata refund will be provided in cases where we terminate the

    <div class="legal">
      <h4>Refund Conditions</h4>
      <p>
        <span>

          dissatisfied with our service and have not used the service
          excessively, you can cancel within the first 7 days and receive a full
          refund.
